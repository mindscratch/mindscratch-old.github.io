    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I received my copy of <a href="http://www.jstorimer.com/products/working-with-unix-processes">Working with Unix Processes</a> written by <a href="http://www.jstorimer.com">Jesse Storimer</a>. I&rsquo;d heard about the book months ago, it might have been even longer.</p>

<p>Today I had some to sit by myself and do some reading.<!--more--> Here&rsquo;s are my thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>great information: this book contains lots of great information about working with processes, as you might expect. The key here is that Jesse actually delivers, what a delight.</li>
<li>easy to read: something about the font, spacing and use of whitespace on pages was really pleasant</li>
<li>just enough: content, Jesse doesn&rsquo;t bore you with 500 pages of information copied from Linux man pages, instead he hits the key points and provides enough information to really give you a great understanding of what&rsquo;s going on with processes in Unix</li>
</ul>


<p>If you&rsquo;re new to Unix or have years of experience, but still aren&rsquo;t real sure what &ldquo;fork + exec&rdquo; is and why it matters, then this book is for you!</p>
